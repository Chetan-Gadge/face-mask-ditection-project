Face Mask Detection master
📝 Brief Description
Face Mask Detection Master is a real-time face mask detection system designed for environments where mask compliance is essential, such as hospitals, offices, public transport, schools, and events. It uses deep learning and computer vision to automatically detect whether people are wearing masks through webcam video feeds.

This project is ideal for:

Developers and students learning about AI, CNNs, and real-time applications.
Organizations looking to integrate an automated safety system.
Researchers exploring computer vision solutions for public health monitoring.
Hackathon participants and final-year project developers.
It helps reduce manual monitoring and promotes safer environments during pandemics or flu seasons.
